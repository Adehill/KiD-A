Introduction
------------

In this version of the TAU microphysics the cloud drop size distribution 
is divided into 34 bins with a radii range of 1.56 to 3200 microns and 
mass doubling from one bin to the next. The method of moments 
(Tzivion et al. 1987, JAS) is used to solve for mass and number 
concentration in each size bin that result from diffusional growth 
(Tzivion et al 1989, JAS), collision-coalescence and collisional breakup 
(Tzivion et al, 1987 and Feingold et al, 1989, JAS). Sedimentation is 
performed using a first-order upwind scheme. Aerosol are represented 
by a single prognostic variable that is assumed to be ammonium 
sulfate with a log-normal distribution (Stevens et al 1996, JAS).

The numerical methods and code in this module have been used in 
a variety of 2-D and 3-D dynamical frameworks to investigate a 
number of cloud microphysical problems. For example, 
drizzle production in marine Sc (Feingold et al, 1996), the 
dynamic and microphysical details of non-precipitating and precipitating 
marine Sc (Stevens et al,JAS, 1996 & 1998), the effect of drizzle on 
cloud optical depth and susceptibility (Feingold et al, JGR, 1997), 
the role of giant CCN in marine Sc, (Feingold et al, JAS, 1999), 
the role of giant CCN in cumulus (Yin et al, Atmospheric Research, 2000), 
turbulence, condensation and liquid water transport in non-precipitating 
marine Sc (Wang et al, JAS, 2003) and aerosol-cloud interactions 
(Feingold et al, GRL, 2005; Jiang et al, JGR, 2006; 
Xue and Feingold,JAS,2006; Xue et al, JAS, 2008; Hill et al, JAS, 2009)


Contents TAU scheme tar file 
----------------------------

In the zip file there are the following files and directories:

module_mp_tau_bin.f90
- main bin model. This contains most of the routines for running the TAU model

module_bin_init.f90
- this contains routines that initialise the code variables for the 
  TAU scheme, e.g. the routines in this module set-up the bin 
  boundaries, aerosol and the collection kernels.

mphys_tau_bin_declare.f90
- declarations required for the bin model in the KiD model

mphys_tau_bin.f90
- this is the wrapper that couples the TAU schem to the 1D framework.

tau_data
- directory containing the collision-coalescence and breakup kernels


Running the TAU scheme in KiD
-----------------------------

Read the documentation for the KiD model and install the KiD model.

In the release version there is directory called "src", which 
contains all the source code for the KiD model and the 
released microphysics schemes. 

- In src there is a dummy file "mphys_tau_bin.f90", 
  replace this file with the mphys_tau_bin.f90 in this tar file 
 
- Copy the module_mp_tau_bin.f90, module_bin_init.f90, 
  mphys_tau_bin_declare.f90 files and tau_data directory into src.

- In one of the namelists for a warm case (warm1 to 7) set the following
    
   ! number of moments for each species	
   num_h_moments= 2,0,0,0,0	
   num_h_bins=34,1,1,1,1	
   ! Background values for eachmoment (assumed the same for all species)
   mom_init=0,0,0   
   
   it is important to make sure that mom_init is set to 0 or the TAU model 
   will crash or produce strange answers!!

   Change the "!Aerosol Initialisation" section of the namelist to 
    ! Aerosol initialization		
    num_aero_moments=1,0,0
    num_aero_bins=1
    aero_N_init=100.e6, 0., 0
    aero_sig_init=1.5, 0., 0
    aero_rd_init=0.05e-6, 0, 0.

    Where aero_N_init is the aerosol number conc (/m^3),  aero_rd_init is the mean radius of the aerosol distribution (m) and aero_sig_init is the standard deviation of the aerosol distribution. At present aerosol is only coded up to use number as this is all that is required. The aerosol distirbution of assumed to be a single mode log normal distribution.   

   set 
   mphys_scheme='tau_bin'

Example namelists for the CU and Sc case are included in this package.  

By making these changes the TAU model will run in the KiD model. 

Other TAU specific parameters:

The general release of the KiD contains a module "switches_bin.f90". The switches in this modules permit the user to select
   
   l_coll_coal - switches on collision-coalescence
   l_break - switches on collisional breakup (only works is l_coll_coal=true)
   l_sed_ult - true switches on ULTIMATE sedimetation, false uses first order upwind scheme 
   	     (ULTIMATE sedimentation not available in present release, so switch does not work)

If l_coll_coal is false the model with simulate activation, cond/evap and sedimentation as a default

In "Switches.f90" there is the following switch

 l_noadv_aerosols  
- not used with the bin scheme
l_fix_aerosols
- if .true. aerosol will be constant throughout the simulation, 
  i.e. no change due to microphysics or transport
- if .false. aerosol will be removed by activation and 
  replenished following complete evaporation of a drop, and aerosol will be advected 

The above should permit a user to run a variety of configurations 
of the TAU scheme in the KiD model.

Changes/fixes from tau_release_1.1.489 to tau_release_2.2.489 (30/04/12)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modified the interface so that it will work with the KiD version 2, i.e.
changed all declarations so TAU scheme can run in 1-D or 2-D

The TAU scheme, and the whole KiD model has been tested with 
ifort-12 and gfortran 4.4.5 on red hat linux in both debug mode with 
no optimisation and optimisation of -O3. All these tests produced the 
same results irrespective of compiler or optimisation   

Changes/fixes from tau_release_1.1.489 to tau_release_1.2.489 (07/01/10)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the coupling between the TAU scheme and the KiD model (in mphys_tau_bin.f90). 

  In tau_release_1.1.489, microphysics was being called for the lowest level. 
This could be important if a simulation used a low resolution, as processes such 
as evaporation are not calculated.
 
  This has been fixed in the interface (mphys_tau_bin.f90) by setting the thermodynamic 
and microphysics variables that are passed into the TAU scheme a level higher before 
the call to, e.g. tau_bin
 
  rhon(2:kkp)=rho(1:kkp-1)

  where rhon(2:kkp)is TAU density and rho(1:kkp-1) is the KiD density

  The values are set back following the call to tau_bin 

- Removed ULTIMATE sedimentation

  Further testing has shown that this code is not stable for all cases, so it has 
been removed from this release. Once the code is stable we will issue an update with this code. 

  The switch for ULTIMATE sedimentation (l_sed_ult) is still in switches_bin but it does nothing

Changes/fixes from tau_release_1.2.489 to tau_release_1.3.489 (05/03/10)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Compiling with ifort 11.1 higlighted three divide by zero associated 
  with array operations in the coupling between the KiD framework and 
  the TAU scheme. These errors do not occur with ifort 10 and below 
  when optimised, but they are still there. This version corrects these errors.
